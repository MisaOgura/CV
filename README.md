### Who Am I?

I wonder how things work.

This urge to know how things work --> biology...

Then in coding, I re-discovered an ideal place to explore my curiosity and creativity. I have found few things that provide this degree of freedom and satisfaction that coding offers.

I have recently built [Japanesify](https://github.com/rachelsmithcode/nodeboard.git) as part of a group project week at Makers Academy. It is an [open-source](https://github.com/MisaOgura/japanesify.git) web application that converts names into Japanese characters. It has become popular and many started to use their Japanese names in internal messaging channels. Even such a small change in people's lives brought me a tremendous joy.

This is why I want to follow the path to become a developer. I want to create multi-platform software which is easy and fun to navigate and satisfies usersâ€™ curiosities.

### Key skills

#### + Passionate learner
Always on a hunt for learning new technologies and pushing boundaries of my knowledge / skills.

This was put to test during my time at Makers Academy. From a complete beginner in programming, I have grown as an aspiring developer and produced over 10 projects with different languages and frameworks ( selected projects below ).

| Application       | Summary          | Key technologies|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Smart Alarm [frontend](https://github.com/MisaOgura/smartAlarm-mobile.git), [backend](https://github.com/MisaOgura/smartAlarm) | A decoupled mobile application to help planning journeys depending on tube disruptions and weather conditions. | Ionic ( frontend ), Ruby on Rails ( backend ), RESTful API, 3rd party APIs. Tested with Rspec, Karma and Protractor |
| [Japanesify](https://github.com/MisaOgura/japanesify.git) | A single page responsive web application that converts your names to Japanese characters. Available on Heroku: [Japanesify](https://japanesify.herokuapp.com/) | AngularJS ( frontend ), regex-based conversion algorithm. Tested with Karma and Protractor |
| [Github Grabber](https://github.com/rachelsmithcode/nodeboard.git) | A single page responsive web application for requesting Github profiles based on usernames. Available on Heroku: [Github Grabber](https://github-grabber.herokuapp.com/) | AngularJS ( frontend ), Node.js ( backend ), RESTful API, Github API |

#### + Adaptable communicator

Having left Japan at the age of 21, I have naturally developed adaptability towards diverse situations and cultures.
- experience from the love for travels

#### + Determined problem-solver

- skills as a researcher: logical & analytical thinking
- how I managed to branch out a new project from the one that was not running

#### + Volunteering

- Battersea...

### Education

#### Makers Academy (February 2016 - May 2016)

+ A particular focus on Agile development, object-oriented programming, and test/behaviour-driven development
+ Primarily self-guided and practice-based
+ Grew confidence in facing problems, not by trying to know everything, but by knowing where and how to find answers

While I developed appreciation for a well-refactored clean code, I have also learned that being a developer is not all about being able to code. Working extensively on multiple group projects, I have experienced highs and lows of teamwork. I strive to create an adaptable environment with active discussions, open communication and respect to each other.

- SOLID, MVC, DDD
- Software Craftsmanship
- Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js, AngularJS
- Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Karma, Protractor

#### University College London (March 2013 - June 2016)

- M.Phil. ( expected ) in Cancer Cell Biology
- In affiliation with Cancer Rsearch UK
- Research Project: Mechanisms of Metastasis in Breast Cancer

#### University of Warwick (October 2009 - July 2012)
- B.Sc. in Biochemistry
- Upper Second-Class Honours
- Research Project: Cellular Water Transport System in Plant Embryo
