### <a name="whoami">Who Am I</a>
---

#### + Laboratory scientist
I am a Biomedical scientist specialised in cancer research.
I wonder how things work, and this has always been the drive of my life. This is why Biology fascinates me. It is an ultimate study of how we work - how life works.

#### + Turned developer
Then in coding, I re-discovered an ideal place to explore my curiosity and creativity. I have found few things to date that provide this degree of freedom and satisfaction coding offers.

Recently, I created [Japanesify](https://japanesify.herokuapp.com/) as part of a group project week at Makers Academy. It is an [open-source](https://github.com/MisaOgura/japanesify.git) web application that converts names into Japanese characters. It has become popular within the organisation and many started to use their Japanese names in internal messaging channels. Even such a small change in people's lives brought me a tremendous joy!

#### + What's next ?
I am currently looking for a role that will allow me to further grow as a changemaker. I thrive in an environment where I will be constantly challenged to push boundaries of my knowledge and skills. My particular interests are in creating multi-platform software that :
+ is easy and fun to navigate
+ satisfies usersâ€™ needs and curiosities

### <a name="skills">Key Skills</a>
---

#### + Adaptable communicator
Having lived away from home since young, I have naturally developed independency and interpersonal adaptability.

My work experience as an academic tutor for A-level and university-level students has equipped me with skills to :
+ simplify complicated concepts with real-life examples
+ carefully adjust conversations according to personality
+ yet still be assertive of priorities

At Makers Academy, I pair-programmed every day with different persons. In addition, working on group projects following agile principles further helped me improve as a confident communicator.

#### + Passionate self-driven learner
Always on a hunt for pursuing new knowledge and technologies.

From a complete beginner in coding, I have produced [over 15 projects](https://github.com/MisaOgura?tab=repositories) independently and collaboratively, all completed under very tight time constraints at Makers Academy. Below are selected projects listed in a chronological order to demonstrate the increasing complexity of the projects.

| <a name="projects">Project</a> - link to repo | Completion time | Summary | Key technologies |
| --------------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-----: | ---------------: |
| [Chitter](https://github.com/MisaOgura/chitter-challenge) | 2 days | A twitter clone with basic functionality to post peeps and comments. Available on Heroku: [Chitter](https://chitter-app-misa.herokuapp.com/users/new) |  Ruby, Sinatra, DataMapper, PostgreSQL, RESTful API. Tested with RSpec, Capybara. |
| [Github Grabber](https://github.com/MisaOgura/github-grabber) | 2 days | A single page responsive web application for requesting Github profiles based on usernames. Available on Heroku: [Github Grabber](https://github-grabber.herokuapp.com/) | AngularJS, Node.js, RESTful API, Github API. |
| [Japanesify](https://github.com/MisaOgura/japanesify.git) | 1 week | A single page responsive web application that converts your names to Japanese characters. Available on Heroku: [Japanesify](https://japanesify.herokuapp.com/) | AngularJS, regex-based conversion algorithm. Tested with Karma and Protractor. |
| Smart Alarm [Frontend repo](https://github.com/MisaOgura/smartAlarm-mobile.git) [Backend repo](https://github.com/MisaOgura/smart_alarm_v2) | 2 weeks | A mobile application to help planning journeys depending on tube disruptions and weather conditions. | Ionic, Ruby on Rails, RESTful API, 3rd party APIs. Tested with Rspec, Karma and Protractor. |

#### + Logical thinker
As a laboratory scientist, I have developed the ability to think logically and approach problems from multiple perspectives, which can be applied to any tasks at hands.

Logical thinking allows me to :
+ grasp a big picture of the problem space
+ identify and separate problems
+ create hypotheses
+ test hypotheses
+ repeat the process to narrow down causes/solutions

#### + Determined problem-solver
Perseverance and patience, combined with logical thinking, make me a determined problem-solver who never gives up, but also knows when to step back for a break. In fact, **debugging** is my favourite bit in software development!

Biomedical research often takes months to appreciate results. Also, due to the nature of the subject ( because no two life forms are exactly the same ), the data acquired is often ambiguous. Thanks to this, I have developed a great degree of patience and serendipity towards problems in general.

The fast cycle of hypothesis testing in coding is such a satisfying process. I get to see the result of what I do straight away in black and white. And this is what I love about coding.

### <a name="passion">Passion</a>

#### + Travel

I am a keen traveler. Countries I have been to include :
+ Australia
+ Canada
+ China
+ England
+ France
+ Finland
+ Germany
+ Iceland
+ Italy
+ Switzerland

I prefer traveling alone, because it allows me to immerse myself fully into the culture and people. I am enthusiastic about randomly starting conversations with fellow travelers and locals, listening to their stories and sharing mine.

The USA and Africa is on the top of my list as the next destination!

#### + Reading

My favourites are fantasy and Sci-Fi novels.

Reading, to me, is another form of travel. When I read, I live through the stories. I feel what characters feel, think, see, smell and taste.

I love travelling the real world but sometimes books are just better with flying cars, riding on a dragon's back, reaching to another solar system in a second and flying with your umbrella!

My absolute favourite of all time is ** _Hard-Boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World_ ** by Haruki Murakami. The seemingly unrelated two worlds are beautifully and witfully told in parallel. From the moment the link unfolds to the climax, it is an emotional rollercoaster. He shakes your feelings, makes you question what you know about the worlds and will leave you empty and yet in an awe of his pure genius. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
